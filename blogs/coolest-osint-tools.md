## **What Is OSINT?**
Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) refers to the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information from publicly available sources, including but not limited to the internet. OSINT has become increasingly popular among law enforcement, intelligence agencies, and businesses, as well as individual researchers and journalists. With the rise of social media and other online platforms, there is an abundance of information available to be mined and analyzed.

# **My Favorite Tools**

## **PhoneInfoga:**
PhoneInfoga is an OSINT tool that allows you to gather information on a particular phone number. It can extract information such as carrier information, location, and social media profiles associated with a phone number. PhoneInfoga can also perform recon on a phone number to gather additional information. It's an awesome tool, free, comes with a web-UI that can be deployed. There are plugins like numverify API tokens you can configure to get more out of it, which is what I've done. Never wonder again who that was that just called you.

## **SubLister:**
SubLister is an OSINT tool that allows you to gather subdomains associated with a particular domain. It can extract subdomains from various sources such as certificate transparency logs, search engines, and brute-forcing. With SubLister, you can gather a list of subdomains associated with a particular domain, which can be useful in reconnaissance and penetration testing.

**No Image at this time, I've used it but I don't have it on this Mac because Homebrew doesn't carry it. I use "SubFinder because it's on Homebrew. Same function but SubLister is the majority perference."**

## **DNSDumpster:**
DNSDumpster is an online OSINT tool that allows you to gather information on a domain. It can extract information such as DNS records, subdomains, and open ports. DNSDumpster can also perform brute-forcing to find subdomains associated with a particular domain.

Another tool that is similar to the ones mentioned above is Shodan. Shodan is an OSINT tool that allows you to search for devices connected to the internet, including servers, routers, webcams, and more. It can extract information such as IP addresses, open ports, and server banners. Shodan can also perform advanced searches based on location, operating system, and other parameters. **[Shodans browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shodan/jjalcfnidlmpjhdfepjhjbhnhkbgleap?hl=en-US)** is amazing and one of my favorite tools, very powerful.

In conclusion, the above-mentioned OSINT tools can help you gather information on a target and perform reconnaissance on a particular domain or phone number. These tools can be extremely useful for law enforcement, intelligence agencies, businesses, and individual researchers. There is a mass amount of information made public via the internet and it's interesting to see as the internet matures we are finding ways to collect/share this information. Just remember, every single thing you put on the internet is forever, and OSINT is here to stay.
