# The eJPT by eLearnSecurity and INE.com
## Certified Junior Pentester
### By Brendan Frisby

> The eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester) is a certification that demonstrates an individual's knowledge and skills in penetration testing and ethical hacking. The certification is offered by eLearnSecurity, a company that provides training and certification in IT security.

The eJPT certification is designed for individuals who are new to the field of penetration testing and ethical hacking. The certification covers a wide range of topics, including:

- Information gathering
- Vulnerability scanning
- Exploitation
- Post-Exploitation
- Reporting

To earn the eJPT certification, individuals must pass an online exam that tests their knowledge of these topics. The exam is practical in nature and requires individuals to demonstrate their skills by completing a series of tasks. The certification is valid for two years, after which recertification is required.

Individuals who earn the eJPT certification are considered entry-level penetration testers and are able to perform basic penetration testing tasks. The eJPT certification is not a professional certification and is not a substitute for experience. But it is a good starting point for individuals who want to break into the field of penetration testing and ethical hacking.

## V1 vs V2 

I strongly recommend the V1 version of the eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT) course over V2. The V1 course was much shorter in length and all the materials were in the form of readable slides straight and to the point. In contrast, V2 is an extended version of V1, covering the same information in a longer and more drawn-out video format. 

V2 does go further into detail on the same topics. I did pickup a few things from V2 that were not covered in V1 but for the most part it was the same. I think V1 is just INE/eLearnSecurity's old eJPT, they just call it V1 now? V2 is 3x as long.

## The Test....

The test was a penetration test situation where you're testing a company's network. There were 4 Windows machines and 2 Linux. To pass you need to be pretty good at all types of enumerating a target. There are 35 questions, 3 are flags hidden. About 5 are questions related to what exploit works on each of the first 6 machines. Then once you exploit these 6 machines one of them gives you access to an internal network and you have to exploit another machine. So another 4-5 questions related to that process. The remaining questions were pretty much enumerating useranmes, and cracking 4 passwords. 

It was more challenging than I expected. They give you 48 hours and that's more than enough time. It took me about 4-5 hours of sitting at the computer and I've heard other people report the same. 

I wish it was openvpn connection and my own lab but it was some Kali browser similiar to the labs during the course. 

## What the eJPT did do for me

The eJPT course did provide me with a solid foundation in various skills such as ARP poisoning, Python scripting, tools like Metasploit and Burp Suite, Wireless Attacks, Exploitation, and Post-Exploitation techniques. It is a great starting point for building more advanced knowledge and skills in the field of penetration testing. I believe that for anyone to get the most out of this course, they must use the tools and techniques outside of the course constantly, as repetition is key to mastering any skill. 

Working on the OSCP and will review it as well.
