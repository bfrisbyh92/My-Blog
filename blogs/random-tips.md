excerpt: I've been fortunate enough to setup zsh at least 4-5x on my Mac M1. I add custom functions and aliases to my .zshrc file for everything. I've also found a number of random packages extremely useful. I want to share those bits of information somewhere.

# Random Terminal Tricks and Tips

As an engineer or developer, we love having full control over the tools and processes we use.  One of the best ways to achieve this is by mastering the command line and customizing it to our needs. Many will say GUI's are eewy, and I agree. I have found that using ZSH and customizing it with functions, aliases, and plugins/addons has made my life much easier. I also make use of automation scripts using Python to automate repetitive tasks on my Mac. Additionally, I have discovered a number of packages that are available on all major operating system package managers, such as Linux VMs, Mac M1, and Termux on Android. These packages have helped me solve various problems, such as exiftool for hiding files inside a photo or w3m for viewing my browser inside the terminal. 
            
Overall, these tools have proven to be extremely helpful in completing tasks and are versatile enough to be used across different platforms. I'll try and list all the random tips, tricks, and packages I've picked up at this point in my journey. 


## List
#### ***It will grow over time, this is not definite***

- w3m package, can be downloaded on any package manager and I use accross platforms to view browser in terminal
- browsh and Lynx are two alternative packages to w3m. browsh is a more complete almost real in terminal browser but you have to have firefox installed for some reason and feels like using a browser, which defeats the purpose for me but a cool tool. Lynx is similiar to w3m, w3m is just my preferance. These can also be used to view files or anything, making that way more interactive
- ways to use tor are abundant. We have the tor command, torify can be called to torify any application and comes with tor
- torsocks, command line and can torify your shell
- proxychains used with tor. Easy and most effective
- OnionShare is awesome, share, chat and host anything on tor easily. 
- catimg is awesome for viewing images in your terminal
- exiftool allows you to hide files inside images
