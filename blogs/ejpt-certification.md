# The eJPT by eLearnSecurity and INE.com
## Certified Junior Pentester
### By Brendan Frisby

> The eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester) is a certification that demonstrates an individual's knowledge and skills in penetration testing and ethical hacking. The certification is offered by eLearnSecurity, a company that provides training and certification in IT security.

The eJPT certification is designed for individuals who are new to the field of penetration testing and ethical hacking. The certification covers a wide range of topics, including:

- Information gathering
- Vulnerability scanning
- Exploitation
- Post-Exploitation
- Reporting

To earn the eJPT certification, individuals must pass an online exam that tests their knowledge of these topics. The exam is practical in nature and requires individuals to demonstrate their skills by completing a series of tasks. The certification is valid for two years, after which recertification is required.

Individuals who earn the eJPT certification are considered entry-level penetration testers and are able to perform basic penetration testing tasks. The eJPT certification is not a professional certification and is not a substitute for experience. But it is a good starting point for individuals who want to break into the field of penetration testing and ethical hacking.

## V1 vs V2 

I strongly recommend the V1 version of the eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT) course over V2. The V1 course was much shorter in length and all the materials were in the form of readable slides straight and to the point. In contrast, V2 is an extended version of V1, covering the same information in a longer and more drawn-out video format. Unless you need the additional repetition provided by V2, it is largely unnecessary and does not add much value to the V1 course.

I found V1 to be an adequate introduction to the material and more than sufficient for passing the V2 exam. In retrospect, I would have skipped V2 and only taken V1, then paid for the V2 exam separately. I personally prefer reading materials over watching videos, as it allows me to absorb the information more efficiently and at a faster pace. Additionally, reading is more engaging and requires more focus, allowing me to retain more. In the future, I will likely find ways to study the material in a more self-directed way. Still grateful INE created it, kept it affordable and is gaining traction in the field.


## One More Thing....

Overall, I found the eJPT certification to be relatively and not challenging but introduced the right techniques. It's definetly worth the money I'm not at all bashing it. I wouldn't of taken it if I didn't think it was a great investment on my time. With that said, the quizzes were not difficult and had one maybe two questions, which I found to be strange. I prefer to challenge myself. I can see how someone could take a course like this and still know nothing because the course itself is not going to push you but they do give you the correct material if you choose to use it outside of the certification. So I guess it just depends on your real motivations.The material alone wasn't enough to be like, I took this so I know my s***. It does introduce all the right things. So I think it reasonable and most people will agree it's a great starting point but to get past the IT gatekeeps, they want to see OSCP, CEH, and OSWP certificatoins. It may be possible to get your foot in the door with just the eJPT. I'm certainly going to start trying but I have completed General Assembly's Software Engineering Immserive, which gave me some foundational IT/Coding knowledge and plays well with the eJPT. I'm still glad I took the eJPT even though I'll follow up with OSCP next and then OSWP. I wish I would of gone straight for the OSCP but honestly I didn't have the funds at the time and the eJPT kept me occupied. eJPT is $200 and OSCP is $1,500ish. 100% worth the money, free subscription for INE and almost free content(I paid one month past the trial and finished. Cost me $40 for one month fee). $200 for the exam, $240 total well worth it for that price. 

## What the eJPT did do for me

The eJPT course did provide me with a solid foundation in various skills such as ARP poisoning, Python scripting, tools like Metasploit and Burp Suite, Wireless Attacks, Exploitation, and Post-Exploitation techniques. It is a great starting point for building more advanced knowledge and skills in the field of penetration testing. I believe that for anyone to get the most out of this course, they must use the tools and techniques outside of the course constantly, as repetition is key to mastering any skill. 

Working on the OSCP and will review it as well.
