This is a big one, so make sure you got the time to read it, and if you are one my colleagues at Atlan, I have mentioned some you in the post as well, so make sure you read it too!

Little bit of a back story before I move on to the main part of this blog. I once applied for a frontend internship
at Atlan as a 17 year old and got rejected. I was pretty sad and demotivated at that time, but I applied for other opportunities
at smaller organisations and ended up getting an internship at an Ed-Tech based startup called CuriousJr. I worked there as an intern
for nearly an entire year, before I moved on to my next internship at Social3. Now when Atlan rejected me,
as much bad it made me feel, I knew I had to work harder and get into that company someday, cause I don't know, it 
felt like love at first sight. 1 year since then and I'm here, writing this blog while working as a Product Engineering
Intern at Atlan. It's crazy how things just turn out the way you want them to, when you're working harder and harder towards achieving what 
you really crave for. At times it might feel like you're not getting anywhere, but trust me, you are. You just need to keep going.

It was the 3rd of June, when I applied for a frontend intern position at Atlan, my previous internship at CuriousJr had just ended, and once things end,
figuring out what you'll do next is the most difficult part. I was pretty sure I wanted to work at Atlan, but I wasn't sure if I'd get in. I mean come 
on they get thousands and thousands of applications, and I was just a teenager, who had little to no experience. I was pretty sure I'd get rejected yet again,
but I applied anyway on their [careers page](https://atlan.com/careers/?p=open-positions/#job-list).

## Interview Rounds

So there are in total 4 rounds of interviews, and the entire interview process in my case, took around 1 and half months before I finally received the offer letter.
<br>
<br>
### Resume Acceptance
The first round might seem easy but do not underestimate it cause quite a lot of people have reached out to me telling me how they sent in their resumes
but never heard back from Atlan. Now honestly I believe in making the resume as simple as possible, while keeping it both informative and visually appealing. You can check out
my resume if you want to [here](https://jaagrav.in/resume) or check out the resumes of people you admire and try to make your resume similar to theirs. I'm not saying copy their resume,
but try to make yours look as good as theirs, make it unique, not to boring and classic, treat your resume like you're designing the UI of a website and you need to make
sure that the UI looks good and the UX is just as good as well. At the end of the day, what I have noticed from applying to multiple companies and getting offers
is that a recruiter doesn't care about your technical skills, what they do care about is what they see, if you have a good looking portfolio, a good looking resume, and maybe
whether or not you go to a good college/institution or not. Now that might be something you'd disagree with, but even my mentors who have worked/working at companies like Microsoft, Polygon, Stripe,
and some other successful startups have always told me one thing, and that is college name does matter, yeah maybe at the end of the day, it's your skills that matter when you get a job as a developer,
but the first step to get the job is getting your resume accepted, and a recruiter most of the times are not engineers, they are given a specific list of skills they need to look for in a candidate,
if the candidate shows it well enough in their resume, they get shortlisted, and then they get an interview, otherwise most of the candidates are judged based on their background, which college they're from,
how much experience do they have working in a team, how versatile are they, etc. So yeah, even the stuff that feels like it doesn't matter, does matter, and that's why make sure your resume looks 
good, and have a good looking portfolio as well. After all, even if you're a developer, you're not developing to satisfy yourself by somehow solving problems, you're developing for the end user, and as long as you follow
that mantra, your users will be happy, which means your manager will be happy, which means you will be happy. This is honestly something that I learnt during my internship here among a lot of other things,
and I'm really grateful for that. This is the benefit of working at a product based startup, you get to learn a lot of things that you wouldn't have learnt otherwise. It took around 2-3 weeks before 
I received the mail saying that my resume was accepted, and I was shortlisted for the next round. <br><br>

### The Challenge Round
This is the second round, **THE MOST IMPORTANT ROUND**, and this is where you get to show your skills. Not to brag but I was honestly super confident 
about this round cause I kind of knew what to expect, since I had already qualified that round before. Basically they send you a google doc with a problem statement, and you have to solve it, you're given
a week's time which can be extended if you ask for it. So since I applied as a Front End Developer, my problem statement was to basically build just the front end of a website, now I can't give
away all the details of what I exactly made, but one thing I would like to add is that, a website with just the frontend feels wrong, it's like a car without an engine, it's just not complete. So I 
knew I wanted to go the extra mile and make it as functional as possible, and that's why I created my own backend, I created my own API, that ran in a docker container, and added as many features as 
I could think of for the problem statement they presented. To sum it up, I used NextJS, Tailwind, ExpressJS, and some other libraries/frameworks to develop the project and heroku to deploy the container which 
is no longer live cause they discontinued their free plan. Although I would say that they prefer developers with Vue background rather than React. Remember they judge your work based on how well you structure your 
code, how well it performs, and how well your execution for the problem statement was. I finished my assignment in 3 days, and I was pretty happy with the result, I knew I had went way beyond the extra mile 
for a frontend assignment, but I was telling myself not to feel too confident, cause that way somehow it's easier to deal with rejection, just in case. So I submitted my assignment, and waited for 
a week, no response. I thought I got rejected, so sure that I joined as an intern at another Web3 based startup Social3, I was quite happy with working at Social3 and I had already kind 
of started to accept my rejection from Atlan, but then after around 2 weeks of silence, I received a call from one of the recruiters and now my friend [Murthy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/murthy-ravi-391177148), who called me and told me they'd like 
to move ahead with my application and sent me a calendly link to schedule my technical interview.

### The Technical Round
I was super happy, but this time I was nervous, I was facing towards the third round, perhaps the scariest round
because this is where your skills get questioned. Now the issue of being a self taught developer is that, we understand the concepts well enough but we don't learn the right terms for things, like if I ask
you,
> What does hydration mean in NextJS?

Most developers apparently don't know what hydration means, again something that I learnt about when I was working at Social3, I didn't know it during the interview as well and 
I was asked that question in my interview and at first I had no idea until the interviewer kinda hinted at it, and I was like oh yeah, I know what it is. He asked me a bunch of 
questions, most of them were pretty basic, and that's what made it even difficult for me, cause I was expecting it to be some kind of pair coding round, to build something, but it was
mostly the interviewer asking me questions about my project and some basic questions about React and NextJS, and why I chose SSR over CSR for my project, what improvements I would like
to make to my project, etc. The ones I knew, I answered them super confidently but then the ones I didn't know, I was honest about it, I told him I didn't know, and I asked him to explain it to me, 
which he also did. It was like a 45-50 minute interview and I wasn't happy enough with how it went. The interviewer seemed pretty strict as well, and the moment the call ended, I felt like 
I had butchered the interview, and should be glad with where I was already interning at, and therefore just to kinda reset my mind and get over the interview, I went to sleep during the afternoon,
and took one of them long depressed naps, cause I wasn't very happy of course. Woke up like 4-5 hours later, just to see a message from [Murthy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/murthy-ravi-391177148) asking me whether the interview happened or not,
and I was like, of course it did, and a couple minutes later, he texts, awesome, the inteviewer just gave me a green signal, we'll set up your cultural interview with the co-founder later this week.
[I was smiling like an idiot, I did not expect that the interview verdict will be handed to me at the end like this.](https://blog.atlan.com/team/interview-backend-engineering-internship/#:~:text=I%20was%20smiling%20like%20an%20idiot)
![Technical Interview](https://iili.io/HYZFpdF.png)
### The Cultural Interview with the Co-Founder
This was the final round, I was both nervous and confident, now let me tell you one thing, when I applied 2 years ago from now for the same position, I had
gotten this far as well, and it was this round where I got rejected. So this time I knew I couldn't screw it up, I honestly till this date still don't know why I got rejected the first time but 
my assumption is, I may have had qualified the technical rounds, but back then I honestly feel the problem statement was super easy, it was just to create a frontend that could do some easy operations like 
sorting, making API calls, etc. but in this interview it was quite a bit harder, probably a reason why I qualified in the first place, cause anyone with good enough knowledge could develop that assignment 
and other than just technical skills, it's also important to have the right soft skills, and I was pretty bad at that back then, I had literally no experience at all, I was just a 
17 year old kid who got lucky enough to have made it to the cultural round and [Varun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varunbanka/) probably knew, this kid has got a lot to learn, and now is not the right time to take him on board. Now that's what
I assume, cause the cultural round is like [Junaid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/junaidrahim/) says in his blog, "a bro-date", and if you fail that round, it might just mean that you're too naive like I was or just lucky to have made it this far.
Now in the cultural round, I talked to [Varun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varunbanka/) like I was speaking to a friend. I tried to act casual while respecting him, introduced myself, tried to not be too formal, and made sure that [Varun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varunbanka/) does not
smell my nervousness. I mean of course you can call it a bro-date or homie-talk, but in the back of your mind you also know you're speaking with the co-founder of a company that's worth in millions, is super
successful, has tons of experience with speaking to clients and investors, and you're just a stupid teenager who is yet to get into a college, trying to convince him to hire you. So yeah it was
definitely overwhelming, but it also did feel like a bro-date cause I was asking [Varun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varunbanka/) about his career plans, how his co-founder and him started the company, what sparked the idea for them to invest in Atlan, 
how he got his first job and 100% scholarship to study abroad, etc. It felt like I was talking to a friend I haven't seen in a while, and I was just trying to catch up with him. He was asking me 
questions about my life and I was asking him about his life, and that conversation slowly turned a bit technical, and he asked about how I built my project, asked me some questions about it, and 
that's when he probably realised that I am a wannabe Full Stack developer, and he told me that he had a better position in mind for me than a Front End Engineering intern, and that position was of a Product Engineering
intern, he explained the position to me briefly and asked me whether I was comfortable or not with his idea, and of course I said yes. Something common when it comes to better opportunities or
making a product better is to never say no or stutter. I was a bit unsure if the position would be a perfect fit for me or not, but I knew I had nothing to lose by saying yes, and being an Indian kid since
I was born, I knew I'd adapt, and if I still lost it, I knew I'd sleep it off and return to my fallback plan. Hell I applied for a frontend position that required me to know Vue, and I had no idea
how to even write Vue code but I knew I'd learn eventually, here I am 5 months into the internship, still learning a lot every now and then, still not a pro at Vue, but the response I get for developing on the ideas 
I work on, not only encourages me to keep going but also makes me want to make what I have already made, better.

### The Final Verdict
So after my cultural interview, I was super happy with how it went, I mean I wasn't sure I'd get the offer, but at least this time I knew I didn't feel how I
felt after the cultural interview, the time I got rejected. You know, it's like taking an exam, and you know how you performed, you can lie to your parents but not to yourself, but when 
you know you did good, even if you haven't yet got the results, you're happy, you're confident, you're sure you'll get the results you deserve, and that's how I felt after the cultural interview.
On the 25th of July, I finally received the offer, so the interview duration was from **3rd June** to **25th July** until the final verdict. The news was delivered to me over a call by [Murthy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/murthy-ravi-391177148), and as he spoke
through the list of perks and benefits I'd be getting, my compensation, and all of that, I was smiling like a horse this time, I honestly couldn't believe it that this was happening to me, if 
this was in public I would have hugged [Murthy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/murthy-ravi-391177148), but I have to act professional, so I said thank you, accepted the offer and hung up the call. Next thing I did was told my mom, called my dad
and gave him the news. My internship was scheduled to begin from the 1st of September, which it did and ever since then I've had the best time of my life. I gave in my 1 month notice at 
Social3, and I could tell my manager there, [Sneha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sneha-mishra-tlp) wasn't happy that I was leaving, but she was happy that I got a better opportunity. Btw do check out [Social3](https://app.social3.club/), they're buidling an alternative 
to LinkedIn but with far better features, and Web3 of course.

I have never fallen in love, or had a kid or anything, or topped in school, or won a [Nobal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nobal-mohan) prize, but I can tell you this, joining Atlan is literally the best thing 
that has ever happened to me so far in my life, and I am not just saying it, I mean it. It is so far my biggest achievement, everyday I wake up knowing that I'll be building something
that our users or as I like to call them, Metamen, have been waiting/requesting for, working with the coolest and the most inspiring manager I've ever had, [Rohan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohan-goel-156086a2/), 
I can write an entire blog on that guy but that might be weird, and working with my awesome colleagues, getting my code reviewed by a freaking core team member of VueJS, having coffee chats with people in the Sales Engineering and Customer Success team,
hearing feedback from our awesome Metamen on stuff I worked on or other teams built and having hours long KTs at 3 in the morning with [Shivansh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivansh-pahwa-38b3b2192/). Atlan is like the biggest play date that just never
ends and you get paid for it. Everyone is super passionate about what they are building, we are not like Apple, we care about our Metamen, we listen to them, we build for them, and that's what I 
believe makes Atlan such a successful startup. The culture here is lovely, you get appreciated for your work, hell there's literally an entire channel on our Slack dedicated to appreciating each other's work,
we have our fair amount of chill sessions, meetups and parties, and I have worked here for 5 months now, my internship was initially of 6 months but got extended to 12 months and hope it extends
to rest of my life, of course I have to work hard for it and I am willing to do that cause of the culture and feedback and how much the HC team cares about the engineers, how much the engineers care
about the product managers, how much the product managers care about the Metamen, and how much the Metamen care about Atlan. Atlanians are honest with both positive and negative feedback, and that's what
helps make any product, a great product.

Can't believe it's already been 5 months here, time is passing by like I took a wiff of cocaine and passed out. The amount of growth I've seen in myself is insane, from technical skills 
to making video presentations/demos for the product I am working on, I have learnt a lot of new things and recognized and discontinued a lot of bad habits. Time management is also something I've 
improved a lot on, I used to be a procrastinator, but now I am able to manage my time way better in between work, college and personal time. A dang lot of things happened in 2022 for me,
hell I bought myself a freaking iPhone that I didn't imagine I even would, until I had a fulltime job, a week before getting it, so most of the things that happened were good honestly and
I can only be grateful for it all, I do have a lot of plans for 2023, and I wonder how many of them I will successfully achieve, I guess we'll see at the end of this year. One thing I do believe 
in now for sure, is that the time I invested in focusing on things that I wanted to do, and not what I had to do, was the best decision I ever made. I am talking 
about school and college of course, 2022 was the year I transitioned from school to college, and I was never good at academics but I believed that me investing towards my passion would 
get me opportunities like this that I'd never get otherwise, and this is just the beginning.
