Every developer has always dreamed of creating something with AI. Be it a robot or just a chatbot that gives mature replies to your questions. Now whenever we've made a chatbot, it's always been a bunch of if-else clauses that could return replies to only specific questions that we would train it for. But with the AcoBot API you can easily add a smart AI chatbot to your website to whom your users can converse with for fun, try out the codepen example to get a glimpse of what it can do.

And those were the APIs folks! Comment down below your favourite API(s), you may also mention any unique/awesome API that you want others to know in the comments down below!

Here's a video by Zeno Rocha that I found where he has mentioned some HTML5, JavaScript Navigator APIs and many more that you might not have ever heard about. These APIs are stupid easy to use and too awesome to not be used in your next project, I would really suggest you to watch this whole video and not skip a part of it because you might miss out on some very exciting APIs.
