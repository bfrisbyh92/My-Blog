# The eJPT by eLearnSecurity and INE.com
## Certified Junior Pentester
### By Brendan Frisby

> The eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester) is a certification that demonstrates an individual's knowledge and skills in penetration testing and ethical hacking. The certification is offered by eLearnSecurity, a company that provides training and certification in IT security.

The eJPT certification is designed for individuals who are new to the field of penetration testing and ethical hacking. The certification covers a wide range of topics, including:

- Information gathering
- Vulnerability scanning
- Exploitation
- Post-Exploitation
- Reporting

To earn the eJPT certification, individuals must pass an online exam that tests their knowledge of these topics. The exam is practical in nature and requires individuals to demonstrate their skills by completing a series of tasks. The certification is valid for two years, after which recertification is required.

Individuals who earn the eJPT certification are considered entry-level penetration testers and are able to perform basic penetration testing tasks. The eJPT certification is not a professional certification and is not a substitute for experience. But it is a good starting point for individuals who want to break into the field of penetration testing and ethical hacking.

## V1 vs V2 

I cannot stress this enough, I enjoyed V1 100x times more than V2. V1 of the course was 1/3 of the course length. It was also almost 100% slides that you can read. Almost 100% of the things covered in V2 are just extremely long drawn out versions of the exact same information that you already did in V1, making V2 almost completely useless unless you need eLearnSecurity to study and put things to use, which personally I don't. Their introduction in V1 was more than enough to get me where I need to be for the V2 test. So even though V1 has all the info, and V2 is a long drawn out version of V1. V2 is the certificatoin that holds the weight. If I could redo it, I would skip v1 and just do v2, take the test and be done. 

If I could have this course be anyway I wanted, I would choose to have V2 also be slides. I'm not a huge fan of long drawn out form of teaching and I proccess much better reading. Why? Because when I'm reading I have to be locked in. There is no other way to read. You get enveloped in the text and take the information in better. You cover more ground, faster, retaining more knowledge. It's also not as easy, fun, or entertaining. That may sound bad to some but if you want to be great you have to sacrifice. You have to learn the most efficient way you can learn. The easy route is almost never the best long term route. In the future, I'll probably just find a way to study the material in this manner. I don't have the time to learn on a general pace, I want to learn at my pace as fast as I can. I can do that when reading material, I can't do that when I have no choice but to finish your video, of which I've already understand the concept.

## One More Thing....

I felt this way during parts of General Assembly as well. I feel like some of these courses are too easy. The eJPT had quizes tons of them but only ever like 1-2 questions on the quiz. That isn't challenging and almost pointless. Sure, it allows the masses to be able to take this class and anyone follow along but that isn't my nature. I want to challenge myself, push myself, do things I didn't think or know I'd ever be able to do. I want to be like fuck idk if I can do this, and suprise myself. I don't want to be taking easy courses like this anymore, they are not where my time is best placed. 

## What the eJPT did do for me

I aquired every skill the eJPT has to offer. Arp Poisoning, Python Scripting, Tools like Metasploit, Burp Suit, Wireless Attacks, Post-Exploitation techniques, Payloads, I mean you name it they covered it. It's a great place for foundational knowledge to build upon with more advanced certifications afterwards. I'm not sure that everyone will have the same results. They will if they use the tools outisde of the course constantly. You have to always keep in mind that you are learning these things but it takes constant repitition to be good at anything. Don't use it? You will lose it. That's Just how it is. I learned a long time ago with weight lifiting that people can accomplish anything, one day at a time, focused, you can always get better at anything. Just set those sights in a direction, commit, DON'T GIVE UP EVER, and see what happeneds.
